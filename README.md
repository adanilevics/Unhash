Finds the contents of a hash by hashing words from a word list, compares the hash to the specified hash, provides the unhashed equivalent.
Also supports brute force - guessing all possible number, letter and symbol combinations for a hash.

Supports SHA-512 and SHA-256 hashes.

See main function for use examples.


TODO :

  organize functions to files,
  fix sha512 output in console,
  add more brute forcing customization options,
  use multiple threads and divide their use evenly across the possible outcomes
